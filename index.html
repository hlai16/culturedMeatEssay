        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Human beings are on the top of the food chain. We are different from other meat-eaters, other species of
            carnivores, and omnivores, that we not just predate our meat whenever we have the need to consume.
            Throughout
            human civilization, we have improved and mastered the art of livestock domestication to breed surplus of
            meat
            for consumption and preservation for storage purpose for later consumption. We enhanced the meat
            quality,
            and
            quantity of what we consume. However, we have entered an era that meat farming is no longer operate in a
            local,
            and small scale. Instead, it is managed by meat industrial corporations. These multi-billionaire
            corporations
            have meat factories, farms across the globe. A single meat product, such as sausages could have meat
            sources
            from a variety of meat farms from variety of countries, mixing, and blending these meat ingredients
            together.
            Furthermore, due to better healthcare, human population have significantly outgrown last century. We
            have
            longer
            average life expectancy, decreased infant mortality rate, and have an overall better living condition
            compare to
            the past. All of these contribute to the rise of food demands, especially meat consumption. Meat
            consumption
            is
            considered a diet for people that had a higher financial standing in the past. We have seen a rise of
            middle
            classes in the past few decades. More and more people are able to spend and consume meat in a daily
            basis.
            All
            of these factors affect the way we domesticate our livestock. In order to meet higher meat demands, meat
            industry have to modify what traditional meat farms practice to increase the meat output to feed and
            satisfy
            the
            appetite of the mass. The problem is, we can no longer continue the way we produce most of our meat
            source
            today. It is not sustainable. We are moving closer to the threshold of irreversible magnitudes. If meat
            farming
            practices are not making drastic changes today, we might face dire consequences, such as societal
            collapse
            in a
            global scale. What makes the Author of this paper think so? The next paragraph will provide you the
            explanations.</p>

        <article>
            <h2 id="thesis">Thesis</h2>
            <p>Firstly, farming industry practices are environmentally and ecologically destructive. Secondly, because
                of
                its
                destructiveness, a meat diet is not sustainable for our over-populated world. In addition, the meat
                industry
                produced their meat with chemicals such as antibiotics and growth hormones injections. Cultured meat, or
                stem-cell-grown meat are the new revolution of meat diet. Lastly, we need to stop having double
                standards on
                the
                treatments of different species of animals. It is imperative to take action to boycott meat farming
                malpractice.
                Human beings must recognize today’s meat production practice is no longer sustainable, we must embrace
                innovative solution to solve this upcoming crisis threshold of natural resources; and at the same time,
                enhance,
                and enrich both consumers, as well as livestock’s quality of living by acknowledging livestock’s rights
                to
                live
                without suffering; and for humans to learn how to respect and live harmoniously with the farm animals.

            <h2 id="pollution">On Land Pollution</h2>
            <p>In regards to the destruction brought by modern day agriculture, one may need only look at the sales of
                farmlands
                across York Region. To name a few, washwater in milking farms is a biohazard to the surrounding
                environment
                of
                the farmland. According to the OMAFRA (Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food, and Rural Affairs),
                washwater
                is
                the wastewater created after cleaning the milking cattle barn. Washwater mainly consists of phosphorus
                chemical
                agents. Phosphorus chemical agents are found in most washing products, such as detergent to kill
                microorganisms
                such as bacteria. If washwater is discarded into freshwater or the environment, it could drastically
                affect
                the
                ecology by killing off many species in the wild. In addition, contact of washwater with freshwater could
                definitely contaminate the loss of drinkable water for all living things, including us.</p>

            <blockquote> “Proper storage and handling of the milking centre washwater containing phosphorus protects
                surface
                waters from eutrophication - a process that increases aquatic plant growth, decreases oxygen levels and
                reduces
                light penetration, all of which harm aquatic life.” (OMAFRA, 2014, Handling Milking Centre Washwater)
            </blockquote>

            <p>Another common farmland pollution is the burial of deadstock. Deadstock refers to meat animals that died
                before
                they can be shipped to meat packing. OMAFRA suggested farmers to bury these dead carcasses within the
                meat
                farms. According to OMAFRA, decomposition could occur within a few months after burial, or may take as
                long
                as
                several years. (OMAFRA, 2015) Dead carcasses, especially deadstock carcasses are full of germs, even
                viruses,
                and releases significant toxicities into the air if not buried into ground in a timely fashion. Even
                when it
                is
                underground, the decomposition process still releases toxic chemicals, and the toxic chemicals, along
                with
                bacteria will mix and spread to the soil. If this is the case, animal farmlands could still be heavily
                polluted
                even years after it ceased operation.

            <h2 id="global-warming">On Global Warming</h2>
            <p> In addition to land pollutions, the livestock contributes to Global Warming. Traditionally, cattle were
                allowed
                to roam in the fields to enjoy a hearty meal of grass. These grass-fed animals’ stomach are divided into
                four
                chambers to digest the distinctive fibres of grass. (York University Guest lecture with David Suzuki,
                2004)
                However, modern farming changes the way we feed these cattle. Instead of letting them roam freely on the
                field
                to find the most nutritious patches of grass to feed on, they were lock into a cell that restraints
                their
                movements. Farmers feed them grains as a replacement to grass. However, the cattle are not able to
                digest
                grains
                properly. As a result, they constantly released excessive carbon dioxide, and methane into the
                atmosphere!
                Please note that methane is a significantly warmer gas than carbon dioxide.</p>
            <blockquote> “The livestock sector is a major player, responsible for 18 percent of greenhouse gas emissions
                measured in CO2 equivalent. This is a higher share than transport. The livestock sector accounts for 9
                percent
                of anthropogenic CO2 emissions. The largest share of this derives from land-use changes – especially
                deforestation – caused by expansion of pastures and arable land for feedcrops. Livestock are responsible
                for
                much larger shares of some gases with far higher potential to warm the atmosphere. The sector emits 37
                percent
                of anthropogenic methane (with 23 times the global warming potential (GWP) of CO2) most of that from
                enteric
                fermentation by ruminants. It emits 65 percent of anthropogenic nitrous oxide (with 296 times the GWP of
                CO2),
                the great majority from manure. Livestock are also responsible for almost two-thirds (64 percent) of
                anthropogenic ammonia emissions, which contribute significantly to acid rain and acidification of
                ecosystems.”
                (FAO, 2006, Atmosphere and Climate Section)</blockquote>
            <p>For the sake of our convenience and cutting-cost-increased-profit mentality, the nature’s balance has
                been tipped.</p>

            <h2 id="hunger">On World Hunger</h2>
            <p>Another downside of feeding crops to the livestock is obviously that instead of harvesting these crops to
                feed the human population around the world, we used our annually harvested crops to feed our livestock
                instead. Quoting from the Food Sense brochure printed by CIWF (Compassion in World Farming), </p>
            <blockquote> “Planet Earth recently heralded its 7 billionth baby. Nearly one billion people are currently
                hungry. By the middle of the century, there will be 9 billion people or more to feed. We need an
                important
                reality check – factory farming is not feeding the world; in fact, the grain-feeding of confined animals
                uses more food than it produces. It is part of a highly resource-intensive and wasteful food system.”
                (CIWF,
                2012, Food Sense Brochure)</blockquote>

            <p>According to CIWF, one third of our cereal harvest are made into animal feeds for our livestock. That
                same
                amount of harvest can actually feed about 3 billion people on Earth. (CIWF, 2012,) The above quote is
                evident that World Hunger is supposed to be an issue of the past. Sadly, due to high demands of meat
                consumption, many have to stay malnourished. It should be said that the majority of the meat consumers
                are
                ignorant about how their meats are produced. Meat Industry like to market and give consumers the image
                that
                the meats consumers buy at Supermarket comes from a rural family farm. This is why many of us are
                oblivious
                to the fact that we are contributing in fueling global disparity, and World Hunger.

            <h2 id="livestock-health">On Livestock Health</h2>
            <p>It should be mentioned that our meat source are not as nutritious as we think. The OMAFRA website
                provides
                current statistics of deadstock recorded in a monthly basis. The data is located under the ‘Statistics’
                subheading in the website. Again, in the OMAFRA webpage, under Dairy Housing Bundle section, it
                discusses
                the
                standard design of barns. Cows are being fit into tight stalls without much movements. (OMAFRA, 2016)
                Given
                how
                crowded the barns are, it is no wonder that livestock are easily prone to catch contagious diseases. To
                prevent
                huge loss of livestock from diseases, there are approved vaccinations or medications or supplementations
                such as
                vitamins by OMAFRA. (OMAFRA, 2015) Due to the way we domesticate livestock today, many of them spent
                their
                entire life within a crate, a stall, a cell. These animals eat, sleep, and defecate at the same tiny
                space
                with
                no other choices. These animals are forced to stand, roll, and lie on their own fecal matter. This
                creates
                contamination. To prevent contamination breakout, farmers administer antibiotics to all livestock. The
                benefit
                obviously is animals are more resistant to diseases. In addition, surprisingly, feeding antibiotics to
                livestock
                could actually increase the animals’ weight, which to the farmer’s standpoint, makes their livestock
                more
                marketable. However, this also means that consumers have inadvertently digest loads of antibiotics
                whenever
                they
                have intakes of meat. As a result, consumers are building up a resistance to antibiotics. (Parr, 2018)
                Given
                the
                practice we use in treating the livestock, how much nutrient would you expect to get from an animal that
                has
                barely be under the sun throughout its entire life, had been in closed confinement so that it has zero
                exercising, and had been subjected to constant stress every single day of its life?</p>

            <h2 id="solution">Cultured Meat Practice on the Horizon. Is this what the World is waiting for?</h2>
            <p>Our way of growing and packing our meat today is barbaric, and outdated. We should abandon this old
                practice
                and
                educate ourselves with new meat growing practice. The new method is safe, economical, and sustainable.
                Cultured
                meat is much more cost-efficient and time-saving practice, because all the meats are grown inside the
                lab.
                Germs
                and bacteria growth are closely monitored and easily eradicate in the lab. The time it takes to mature a
                piece
                of meat (steak) is much faster. It requires much, much less space to store the meat, since stem cell
                technology
                is able to grow meat that are desirable to be consumed by people, there is no need to lab-grown a whole
                animal
                to attain meat. In other words, there is no need to grow crops to feed our meat, freshwater usage level
                are
                reduced to a minimum. (Gaydhane et al., 2018) No animal has to suffer. No pollution. No antibiotic
                injected
                into
                the meat because spread of disease is no longer a concern. Cultured meat is the new food trend!
                Once cultured meat becomes the major meat source in Canada, the Animal Rights Laws and Regulations will
                be
                able
                to include the livestock, poultry, and fishery practice under protection finally. It is heartbreaking to
                see
                that these animals cannot receive the same rights as our pet animals. According to the SPCA website,
                animal
                rights and regulation is based on observed behaviour of animal to determine whether the animal is
                suffering.
                Animal’s suffering is the sole indicator that if caretakers of animal has violated the animal right law.
                However, under the Ontario law of animal right, the law has excluded farm animals, and fish grown in
                fishery
                from protection under this law. (Ontario SPCA, 2015) As I go over the provincial animal laws, I cannot
                help
                but
                calling these lawmakers hypocrites!

            <h2 id="conclusion"> In Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Since the dawn of animal domestication, humans have been shaping farm animals as they see fit. Farm
                animals
                as we
                know today, just like our pets, are barely able to survive without human interventions. We have
                “dehorned”
                most
                of the sheep, “defanged” all the pigs, and “clipped” the chickens’ wings. Now, we are about to move onto
                a
                new
                chapter in meat production – cultured meat. It is by far the best solution to solve the World’s food
                scarcity,
                and rising desire to consume meat. Cultured meat is just at its beginning, and it is already proven to
                the
                World
                it is a cleaner, more sustainable approach to meat production in comparison to our present meat
                production
                approach. By growing meat in small parts that humans have a desire to consume, for example the brisket
                of
                cattle, we can efficiently multiply the productions, and be able to store the meat in an indoor,
                tight-sealed
                environment to greatly eliminate contaminations. All crops grown would be for human consumption only.
                World
                famine would be solved in an instant. All the meat farms could be redeveloped into other purpose, such
                as
                animal
                sanctuary farms for livestock we no longer see as food.</p>

            <h3>Echarts.js</h3>
            <a href="https://github.com/apache/incubator-echarts">https://github.com/apache/incubator-echarts</a>
            <p>I think this plugin use only javascript, no jquery.This is a free plugin to use as indicated in the
                GitHub
                site of echarts. It is licenced by Mike Bostock. It is also available under Apache licence V2.</p>
            <p>It has been created for two years, and last updated occurred just 6 days ago. According to Github,
                echarts is
                now an incubator project of Apache Software Foundation. There is an official website for echarts
                includes
                examples, and documentations. It is based on zrender, a lightweight canvas based library. The
                documentation
                offers several ways to install the plugin. It is quite helpful and straightforward, and easy to follow.
            </p>
            <p>There are lot of charts to choose from. Bar graphs, pie chart, scatter plots, line graph, etc. The
                installation is very straightforward. All it takes it to download the zip file from Github. And drag
                their
                echart.js file to my js folder, and include in the html. Then, I copied its example to test if it's
                working.
                Once confirmed working, I went to their graph library to find the pie chart that I like, and implement
                it. I
                changed the size, the data, the text, and colours of the chart to customize into my liking.
                Customization is
                straightforward since there are examples to follow from. The only thing I wasn't ablt to customize is
                the
                caption (red text)'s size, and line break. I originally wanted the radius of the pie to be 75% of the
                div.
                But, I found that the red text got cut off, and I could not make it into two lines, so I have to
                decreased
                the size of the pie chart to accomodate the red text. In addition, it isn't responsive enough for
                typical portrait cellphone screen sizes.</p>
            <p>Overall, echart.js is an user-friendly experience. I would recommend this plugin to others. And I like
                the
                variety of special options and/or effects they offered in their example library.</p>

            <h3>Highcharts.js</h3>
            <a href="https://www.highcharts.com/">https://www.highcharts.com/</a>
            <p>This chart library is only in javascript. It is licenced by Highsoft AS: <a
                    href="https://shop.highsoft.com/media/highsoft/Standard-License-Agreement-11.0.pdf">https://shop.highsoft.com/media/highsoft/Standard-License-Agreement-11.0.pdf</a>
            </p>
            <p>You can use highcharts for free. There's a free version to download in their website. They also have a
                paid version. While using the free version, I don't see any limitations thus far. They offer many
                customer showcases that uses highcharts in their site. It is under the Community nav link.</p>
            <p>Highchart has been around since 2009, and it is being kept up to date. According to their product page,
                80% of the huge corporations' websites have utilized highchart for their graph data. There are blog,
                community, and support and documentations in the website if encountering difficulties, as well as many
                demos.</p>
            <p>It is SVG based, with fallbacks to VML, and canvas based for old browsers. The documentation is easy to
                find, and helpful. The installation is straight forward. There are many demos of charts to choose from.
                We can customized the chart to 3Ds. There are bar graphs, pie charts, scatter plots, line graph,
                pyramids, tree chart graphs, etc.</p>
            <p>Highchart is very easy to implement. All you need is to download its file which shows on the highchart
                page, then I used to version of adding the cdn to the script, but there are other choices to install
                which comes as straightforward and easy to follow. Customizing the graph again seems pretty easy to
                understand with all the demos and examples in the website to browse through. Maybe the background color
                may require more digging in order to make changes on that, but I don't have
                the same size/ cutoff issues I encounter with echarts. I could make highcharts mobile responsive better
                than echarts.</p>
            <p>Overall, I prefer highcharts over echarts.</p>

            <h3>c3 Chart Library</h3>
            <a href="https://c3js.org/">https://c3js.org/</a>
            <p>This c3 is written only in javascript. c3 is a free chart plugin. The licence is MIT. I cannot see any existing projects in the c3 website, however, there are a good amount of examples to browse through.</p>
            <p>According to its change log, c3 has been around since 2014. Last update took place on October 2019. I think it is being continued developing. There is a forum on the website, a google discussion forum page. It also shows a reference page explaining each code word's meanings. c3 is d3 based reusable library. Because of this, only the most modern browsers are able to load c3 charts. For browsers such as IE10 or older version, they won't be able to see the proper graph with c3 plugin.</p>
            <p>The documentation and examples provided in the website is helpful enough. It is not as easy and without thinking as the previous 2 examples, where I can copy and pasting the examples, and then made some changes to it. Rather, c3 website, in the getting started session, guides users step by steps how to implement this chart library. So users will have an opportunity to learn instead of just copying and pasting. Some basic javascript is required to implement it definitely. It will be very hard for users without prior knowledge in javascript to understand the codes.</p>
            <p>Customization of labels, spacing, and text rotation, and changing graph type are straightforward. Solutions are easily founded in the examples given in the site. However, colour change of graph, and background color are not. I didn't find an example of customizing the background colour of the chart, instead I use css of targeting the div. As for the lines colour, there is an example, but it didn't work. </p>
        </article>
        <h3>Of all three chart libraries, which is the BEST?</h3>
        <p>I think I would recommend highcharts the most. It is the most user friendly, and offers best presentations. Only concern is in the future, it might not be free to use. Second choice would be c3. In a way, I like its simplicity, and as far as colour scheme of graph concern, I could css background color if need be (which I did in this assignment). And if I had more time, I can always asked people in the forum for text and line color customizing. I have to put echart the last, not that it is the worst. It offers similar user experience as highcharts I would say. Both have fancy graphs, it's just that highchart did slightly better than echarts. My main concern is the adjustments of the text label for smaller screen size. I have yet figure that one out. Again, if I have more time, I do believe I would find the solution.</p>
